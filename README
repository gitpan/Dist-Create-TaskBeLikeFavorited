NAME
    Dist::Create::TaskBeLikeFavorited - Create your own
    Task-BeLike-$AUTHOR-Favorited distribution

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    To create and upload your dist to CPAN:

     % create-task-belike-favorited-dist SHARYANTO
     % cd Task-BeLike-SHARYANTO-Favorited
     % # you'll probably want to edit dist.ini first to tweak stuffs
     % dzil release

    To update your dist and release to CPAN:

     % cd Task-BeLike-SHARYANTO-Favorited
     % update-task-belike-favorited-dist
     % dzil release

DESCRIPTION
    "Task::BeLike::$AUTHOR::Favorited" tasks contain modules that have been
    favorited by $AUTHOR (by clicking the "++" button) on
    <http://metacpan.org>. This module creates distributions that contain
    such tasks.

    The created distributions currently require Dist::Zilla and
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::SHARYANTO to be built.

FAQ
  Why?
    Mostly so you can do something like:

     % cpanm -n Task::BeLike::YOU::Favorited

    on a fresh system and conveniently have all your favorite modules
    installed.

    Of course, you'll have to build and upload your task distribution to
    CPAN first (see Synopsis).
